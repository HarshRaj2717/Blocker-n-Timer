# Blocker-n-Timer

Block distracting apps with a pomodoro/countdown timer and also track your progress to increase productivity.

As my older version of this ([App-Blocker](https://github.com/HarshRaj2717/App-Blocker.git)) only works on windows (_but I switched to Linux_) and the older version also had a spaghetti code so I am building it up again from scratch with more features and support for different operating systems.

This is a project I am doing inspired by my own daily needs and hence it will be maintained and updated properly from time to time.
